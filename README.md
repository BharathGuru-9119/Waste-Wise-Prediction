Welcome to **Foodshare** – an open-source platform built to help communities reduce food waste, share resources, and foster sustainability.

## 🚀 Overview

Foodshare is a web application created using:

- **Vite** (for blazing-fast dev/build)
- **React** (UI library)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **Shadcn UI** (beautiful, customizable components)
- **TailwindCSS** (utility-first CSS)
- **Supabase** (backend/database)
- **TanStack Query** (data fetching and caching)

This project was built for a hackathon, where we proudly finished in the **Top 5**!  
We leveraged "vibe coding" sessions to rapidly iterate and build as a team.
